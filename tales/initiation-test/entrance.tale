<title>Starting the Scenario</title>
Now that you have selected classes, each player should take their character and combat cards (basic cards only) and place them in front of themselves. Each scenario in Taelmoor starts by placing a room and any starting pieces in the center of the table as instructed.

For {name tale}, your first room is <piece>{ref}</piece>. Place the Party marker within it – this piece marks your current location on the map, so move it around as you go.

Whenever you see something written like this <piece>{ref}</piece>, it means to place that token or standee within your current room or where otherwise instructed to place it.

Playing Taelmoor involves choosing an action and then scanning a QR code for a target. When you are trying to think of what to do, imagine that you want to "use an <i>action</i> on a <i>target</i>."

To begin playing, try searching the room you're in to learn more about it. To do this, <b>tap the <piece>{ref examine}</piece> action button, and then scan the entrance's <piece>{ref}</piece> QR code</b> as your target.

As you do actions, the scenario updates will appear in messages like this – once you're done reading them, you can close them with the button below.

{name handler}, your handler and the person administrating your trial into The Shattered Band, leads you to a rotting door that marks the entrance to a run-down building in a dodgy corner of Vale.

"After you," he says, waving the way through the now-open doorway. With a gulp, you step past the threshold of the trial..."

=== repeat ===
<title>{name}</title>
You've returned to the entrance for your test. It's as dank and tattered as ever. {pull entrance barrel "details"} {pull entrance handler examine}

>> examine >>
<title>The Trial Begins</title>
<i>In Taelmoor, it's <b>highly</b> encouraged for the player performing the action to read the results out loud! Silly voices and epic oration are encouraged. {name player} should start reading now.</i>

The inside of the building is just as rundown as the outside – it looks like it has long since been abandoned. You stand in the entryway with {name handler} <piece>{ref handler}</piece> waiting a few feet ahead of you.

"Welcome to the trial. Somewhere in this building are your membership medallions for The Shattered Band. Your task is simple: find and claim them. Do so, and you will become a lifelong member of our guild. I will be following along with you to observe, test, and potentially provide help. Feel free to ask me questions at any time, although I may not always provide answers. Good luck."

Other than {name handler} <piece>{ref handler}</piece>, the room also contains a closed {name barrel} <piece>{ref barrel}</piece> in the SOUTHEAST corner and an {name entrance_door} <piece>{ref entrance_door}</piece> to the NORTH.

Unless otherwise instructed, remember to always place highlighted tokens in the current room by putting items and standees on top of the current room's tile, and putting doors and hallways next to it in the indicated direction. In other words, place <piece>{ref handler}</piece> and {name barrel} <piece>{ref barrel}</piece> on top of <piece>{ref entrance}</piece>, and <piece>{ref entrance_door}</piece> to the north in the little matching notch. Which way is north? It doesn't matter as long as you are consistent across the entire scenario, but we recommend orienting things so that "up" corresponds to north.

=== repeat ===
There isn't much to this rather small entryway. You suspect that it contained coat racks and shelves for boots or some such when the building was in use. {pull entrance barrel "details"} {pull entrance handler "details"} {pull entrance entrance_door "details"}

<title>A Rusty Door</title>

You've seen people break down doors, how hard could it be? You take a deep breath and step back from the door as if to charge it, but then you remember that {name handler} <piece>{ref handler}</piece> is watching you.

With {name handler} <piece>{ref handler}</piece> watching, you wiggle your fingers and prepare to show him your skills. Hopefully this door isn't some unpickable trick.

Your worries turn out to be unfounded, as it takes you only seconds to trip the latch and open the door. It swings wide, revealing another room <piece>{ref parlor}</piece> to the NORTH.

A lock. This is what Nahk hates most, and so you're almost certain that they will destroy it if you ask. With {name handler} <piece>{ref handler}</piece> watching, you put one hand on the door lock and the other on the {name} that hangs around your neck. Then, you pray to Nahk to destroy this unholy blockade.

Nahk's response is immediate – the lock simply dissolves and then disappears as if it never existed. The door creaks open in front of you, revealing another room <piece>{ref parlor}</piece> to the NORTH.

> barrel >

>> examine >>
The barrel appears to be as old as the building itself – beyond dusty and partially rotted. Still, it seems like it was well-made, once upon a time, so its structure remains sound. The lid is closed and nailed down and cannot be simply opened. You rock the barrel slightly and think you can feel something solid rustling inside.

{pull "pass explanation"}

The barrel is now nothing but a pile of useless splinters. <if player not has rope>But, some {name rope} <piece>{ref rope}</piece> was hidden inside and still lays among the debris.</if>

<place player rope>
The barrel doesn't want to open? No problem! You'll <i>force</i> it open.

You pick it up and smash it against the wall repeatedly, enjoying the satisfying <i>crunch</i> it makes each time it strikes the stone. Finally, it shatters into a great shower of wooden debris that scatter to the floor below.

Interestingly enough, some {name rope} <piece>{ref rope}</piece> tumbles out from it and lands on top of the heap. You reach down and pick up the bundle, feeling it in your hands. It's clearly new – no doubt planted here to be part of your trial.

{pull rope "in hand"}

<b>Add the rope <piece>{ref rope}</piece> to the party inventory now. From now on, you can scan it as an action by selecting the <piece>{ref use_item}</piece> option and scanning the rope before scanning your target.</b>

=== player is not strong ===
You're sure there's something to this barrel – why would it be here otherwise? You kick it as hard as you can, but are disappointed when it maintains its shape. You notice a jagged bit of wall you could perhaps smash it against, so you try to pick it up, but are disappointed to discover that it's too heavy for you to pick up. Perhaps someone stronger could do so.

<i>(in Taelmoor, some actions must be done by certain characters – exactly one of you is strong enough to do this action. You can tap on their character portrait to pass the turn to them so that they can try immediately. And, because this action did nothing useful and taught your group no new information, it will not use up your turn.)</i>

The barrel is already in tatters, there's no reason to try to break it further.

<retain-turn no>
As you get closer to the barrel, the <piece>{ref search_key}</piece> begins pulling forcefully on its chain like an excited child. There's definitely something hidden inside the barrel, but it appears to be sealed shut – you'll need to figure out some way to get inside.

=== broken ===
{pull search_key "nothing"}

You look all around the barrel to see if perhaps there's something you can pick to get inside it, but are disappointed to discover that this is not the case. It's fully sealed, so your lockpicks can't do much good.

You're going to try lockpicking a pile of busted wood?

{pull "wasted action"}

>> holy_symbol >>
You consider the barrel in front of you. Indeed, it is closed and keeping something inside. But, it is not necessarily <i>locked</i>, so it's possible Nahk might not care about it. You can never be sure exactly what fits their sometimes narrow definition of something being "closed".

You place a palm on the barrel and another on the {name holy_symbol}, and ask Nahk to open this barrel. After a moment, nothing happens... it appears you've been ignored.

{pull "wasted action"}

=== broken ===
Why bother Nahk about something she obviously won't care about?

This is a well-made barrel, with a high number of symmetrical staves bound with steel hoops and nails. If you were to create one yourself, you'd probably choose a similar style of construction. But, since you want to get <i>inside it</i> instead, knowing how it's built is the first step.

You grab a crowbar, wedge it between a hoop and stave, and gently tap with a hammer. The lid comes loose slightly. You continue this process around each stave and loop, quickly and efficiently dismantling the entire barrel into its base materials. An <i>amateur</i> might have just removed the lid, but not you! Now you're staring at a pile of wood, nails, and iron hoops, likely useless.

But, what was once inside is now on top of the pile: a pristine {name rope} <piece>{ref rope}</piece>. You reach down and pick up the bundle, feeling it in your hands. It's clearly new – no doubt planted here to be part of your trial.

This barrel is made from wood, and it is even <i>fresh</i> wood! You can feel the subtle hum of life pouring from it, calling to you, confused as to why it is no longer part of the tree it was milled from.

You begin to sing, channeling the power of Taelmoor itself through the wild apple in your pocket. It is an old song, about the importance of nature and returning to it. The wood in the barrel hears you, and listens. It begins to hum in time with your song, then, all at once, it rots and dissolves into a heap of old wood.

Interestingly enough, some {name rope} <piece>{ref rope}</piece> tumbles out from it and lands on top of the pile. You reach down and pick up the bundle, feeling it in your hands. It's clearly new – no doubt planted here to be part of your trial.

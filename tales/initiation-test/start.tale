{pull "wasted action"}


= "wasted action" =
<i>(Because this action did nothing and taught your group no new information, it will not use up your turn.)</i>


= "pass explanation" =
<i>Only certain players will have abilities that will allow them to get inside the barrel. Everyone's unique abilities were revealed at the start of the scenario but can be reviewed on the party screen. You can pass to a player who you think has a relevant ability by tapping on their portrait.</i>


= "door already open" =
<retain-turn yes>
The door is already open â€“ there's no need to mess with it any further.

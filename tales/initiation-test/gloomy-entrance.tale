<title>Starting the Scenario</title>
Now that you have selected classes, each player should take their character and combat cards (basic cards only) and place them in front of themselves. Each scenario in Taelmoor starts by placing a room and any starting pieces in the center of the table as instructed.

For {name tale}, your first room is {ref}. Place the Party marker within it – this piece marks your current location on the map, so move it around as you go.

Whenever you see something written like this {ref}, it means to place that token or standee within your current room or where otherwise instructed to place it.

Playing Taelmoor involves choosing an action and then scanning a QR code for a target. When you are trying to think of what to do, imagine that you want to "use an <i>action</i> on a <i>target</i>."

To begin playing, try searching the room you're in to learn more about it. To do this, <b>tap the {ref examine} action button, and then scan the entrance's {ref} QR code</b> as your target.

As you do actions, the scenario updates will appear in messages like this – once you're done reading them, you can close them with the button below.

{name handler}, your handler and the person administrating your trial into The Shattered Band, leads you to a rotting door that marks the entrance to a run-down building in a dodgy corner of Vale.

"After you," he says, waving the way through the now-open doorway. With a gulp, you step past the threshold of the trial..."

You've returned to the entrance for your test. It's as dank and tattered as ever. {pull entrance barrel examine} {pull entrance handler examine}

<title>The Trial Begins</title>
<i>In Taelmoor, it's <b>highly</b> encouraged for the player performing the action to read the results out loud! Silly voices and epic oration are encouraged. {name player} should start reading now.</i>

The inside of the building is just as rundown as the outside – it looks like it has long since been abandoned. You stand in the entryway with <ref>{name handler}</ref> waiting a few feet ahead of you.

"Welcome to the trial. Somewhere in this building are your membership medallions for The Shattered Band. Your task is simple: find and claim them. Do so, and you will become a lifelong member of our guild. I will be following along with you to observe, test, and potentially provide help. Feel free to ask me questions at any time, although I may not always provide answers. Good luck."

Other than <ref>{name handler}</ref>, the room also contains a closed <ref>{name barrel}</ref> in the SOUTHEAST corner and an <ref>{name entrance-door}</ref> to the NORTH.

Unless otherwise instructed, remember to always place highlighted tokens in the current room by putting items and standees on top of the current room's tile, and putting doors and hallways next to it in the indicated direction. In other words, place <ref>{ref handler}</ref> and <ref>{name barrel}</ref> on top of <ref>{ref entrance}</ref>, and <ref>{ref entrance-door}</ref> to the north in the little matching notch. Which way is north? It doesn't matter as long as you are consistent across the entire scenario, but we recommend orienting things so that "up" corresponds to north.

[case again]
There isn't much to this rather small entryway. You suspect that it contained coat racks and shelves for boots or some such when the building was in use. {pull entrance barrel examine} {pull entrance handler examine} {pull entrance entrance-door examine}

>>> examine >>>

The barrel <ref>{ref barrel}</ref> sits in the southeast corner.

[case broken]
Broken bits of what used to be an old barrel lay strewn on the floor, too damaged to be useful for anything. [if not player has rope !!TODO] A long bundle of rope <ref>{ref rope}</ref> is found within the debris.

[case here] <ref>{name handler}</ref> stands a few feet away, watching you.
[case not here] You are alone in the room.

The <ref>{name entrance-door}</ref> is closed and locked.
[case open] The <ref>{name entrance-door}</ref> is open, revealing the <ref>{name parlor}</ref> beyond.
